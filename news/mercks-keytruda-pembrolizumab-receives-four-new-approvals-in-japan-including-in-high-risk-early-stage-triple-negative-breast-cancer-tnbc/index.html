  <b>KEYTRUDA now approved for 23 uses in 13 different types of cancer in Japan</b>
</p><p>    RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced that KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, received four new approvals from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW):
</p><ul class="bwlistdisc">
  <li>
KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery for patients with hormone receptor-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence, based on data from the KEYNOTE-522 trial;
</li>
  <li>
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions, based on data from the KEYNOTE-564 trial;
</li>
  <li>
KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer with no prior chemotherapy who are not amenable to curative treatment, based on data from the KEYNOTE-826 trial, and;
</li>
  <li>
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma after complete resection, based on data from the KEYNOTE-716 trial.
</li>
</ul><p>
“Based on compelling data from our clinical trial program, KEYTRUDA has become an important treatment option in Japan and now has 23 approved uses across 13 different types of cancer,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “These four new approvals provide certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer, high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and completely resected stage IIB and IIC melanoma the opportunity to be treated with KEYTRUDA.”
</p><p>
“In Japan, the cancer mortality rate continues to rise annually, and patients are in need of new treatment options – particularly those with breast cancer, which is the most prevalent cancer among women in the country,” said Kyle Tattle, Representative Director and President, MSD Japan. “These new approvals for KEYTRUDA are the result of strong collaboration with the MHLW and provide additional treatment options for appropriate patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.”
</p><p>
  <b>Approval as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment regimen for triple-negative breast cancer
<br></b>The approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery for patients with hormone receptor-negative and HER2-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 trial, in which KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy before surgery and continued as a single agent after surgery resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in event-free survival (EFS), reducing the risk of disease progression that precludes curative surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy or death by 37% (HR=0.63 [95% CI, 0.48-0.82]; p=0.00031) compared to neoadjuvant placebo in combination with chemotherapy and adjuvant placebo alone after surgery in these patients.
</p><p>
The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-522, adverse reactions were observed in 774 patients (98.9%) out of the safety analysis set of 783 patients (including 45/45 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were nausea (63.2%), alopecia (60.2%), anemia (54.8%), neutropenia (46.9%), fatigue (42.1%), diarrhea (30.4%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (26.1%), vomiting (25.5%), asthenia (25.3%), rash (25.0%), constipation (24.0%), decreased neutrophil count (23.6%) and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (20.1%).
</p><p>
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer, which has the highest risk of recurrence within the first five years after diagnosis and is associated with worse outcomes compared to other forms of breast cancer. While some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2, TNBC tests negative for all three. Triple-negative breast cancer is known to be prevalent in Japan, as approximately 15% of patients with breast cancer in Japan are diagnosed with TNBC. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in Japan, with more than 94,000 people diagnosed in 2020.
</p><p>
  <b>Approval in renal cell carcinoma
<br></b>The approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with RCC at increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 trial, in which KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% (HR=0.68 [95% CI, 0.53-0.87]; p=0.0010) compared to placebo.
</p><p>
The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-564, adverse reactions were observed in 386 patients (79.1%) out of the safety analysis set of 488 patients receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks or 400 mg every six weeks for up to 12 months. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were fatigue (20.3%), pruritus (18.6%), hypothyroidism (17.6%), diarrhea (15.8%), rash (15.0%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2%).
</p><p>
Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men than in women. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 25,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 8,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.
</p><p>
  <b>Approval in advanced cervical cancer
<br></b>The approval for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer with no prior chemotherapy who are not amenable to curative treatment is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-826 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 33% (HR=0.67 [95% CI, 0.54-0.84]; p=0.0003), and progression-free survival, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.79]; p&lt;0.0001), compared to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in these patients.
</p><p>
The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-826, adverse reactions were observed in 298 patients (97.1%) out of the safety analysis set of 307 patients (including 35/35 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks in combination with investigator’s choice of anti-cancer regimens. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were alopecia (55.7%), anemia (48.5%), nausea (33.9%), diarrhea (24.8%), peripheral neuropathy (24.4%), fatigue (22.8%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (22.5%), neutropenia (22.1%) and vomiting (20.5%).
</p><p>
Cervical cancer forms in the lower part of the uterus and in the cells lining the cervix. All women are at risk for cervical cancer, and the disease is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 35 to 44. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 12,700 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and nearly 4,200 deaths from the disease in 2020.
</p><p>
  <b>Expanded indication in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma
<br></b>The expanded indication for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma after complete resection is based on results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-716 trial, in which KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.46-0.92]; p=0.00658) compared to placebo in these patients. With this expansion, Keytruda is now approved for the adjuvant treatment of resected stage IIB, IIC and stage III melanoma.
</p><p>
The Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-716, adverse reactions were observed in 400 patients (82.8%) out of the safety analysis set of 483 patients (including 2/2 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were pruritus (24.2%), fatigue (21.1%), diarrhea (18.6%), arthralgia (16.1%), rash (15.7%) and hypothyroidism (15.5%).
</p><p>
Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. In Japan, the rates of skin cancer have been rapidly increasing, and it is estimated there were more than 1,500 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and nearly 700 deaths from the disease in Japan in 2020.

  <strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>®</sup> (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg
<br></strong>KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.
</p><p>
Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

  <b>Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA
<br></b>
  <b>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions
<br></b>KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.
</p><p>
Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.
</p><p>
Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.
</p><p>
  <span class="bwuline">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
<br></span>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.
</p><p>
Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation.

Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both.

  <b>Infusion-Related Reactions
<br></b>KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.
</p><p>
  <b>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
<br></b>Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.
</p><p>
  <b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
<br></b>In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.
</p><p>
  <b>Embryofetal Toxicity
<br></b>Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were musculoskeletal pain (41%), fatigue (40%), rash (30%), diarrhea (27%), pruritus (23%), and hypothyroidism (21%).
</p><p>
Adverse reactions occurring in patients with MSI-H or dMMR endometrial carcinoma who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent were similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent.

</p><p>
Adverse reactions occurring in patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC or locally advanced cSCC were similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy.
</p><p>
In KEYNOTE-522, when KEYTRUDA was administered with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent (n=778) to patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, high-risk early-stage TNBC, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.9% of patients, including 1 each of adrenal crisis, autoimmune encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis in association with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and myocardial infarction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; those ≥2% were febrile neutropenia (15%), pyrexia (3.7%), anemia (2.6%), and neutropenia (2.2%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 20% of patients due to adverse reactions. The most common reactions (≥1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation were increased ALT (2.7%), increased AST (1.5%), and rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA were fatigue (70%), nausea (67%), alopecia (61%), rash (52%), constipation (42%), diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy (41% each), stomatitis (34%), vomiting (31%), headache (30%), arthralgia (29%), pyrexia (28%), cough (26%), abdominal pain (24%), decreased appetite (23%), insomnia (21%), and myalgia (20%).
</p><p>
In KEYNOTE-355, when KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (paclitaxel, paclitaxel protein-bound, or gemcitabine and carboplatin) were administered to patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (n=596), fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.5% of patients, including cardio-respiratory arrest (0.7%) and septic shock (0.3%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy; the serious reactions in ≥2% were pneumonia (2.9%), anemia (2.2%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). KEYTRUDA was discontinued in 11% of patients due to adverse reactions. The most common reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation (≥1%) were increased ALT (2.2%), increased AST (1.5%), and pneumonitis (1.2%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy were fatigue (48%), nausea (44%), alopecia (34%), diarrhea and constipation (28% each), vomiting and rash (26% each), cough (23%), decreased appetite (21%), and headache (20%).
</p><p>
  <b>Lactation
<br></b>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the final dose.
</p><p>
  <b>Pediatric Use
<br></b>In KEYNOTE-051, 161 pediatric patients (62 pediatric patients aged 6 months to younger than 12 years and 99 pediatric patients aged 12 years to 17 years) were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 24 months).

            <div class="forward-guidance-content">
                <p>This news release of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J., USA (the “company”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the company’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. There can be no guarantees with respect to pipeline candidates that the candidates will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that they will prove to be commercially successful.

Risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of the recent global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation in the United States and internationally; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the company’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the company’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions.<br><br>

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at the SEC’s Internet site (www.sec.gov).<br><br>
