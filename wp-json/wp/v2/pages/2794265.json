In October 2009, our company began voluntarily disclosing all payments to U.S.-based health care professionals who speak on behalf of our company about our products and other health care issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We engage with health care professionals around the world to conduct company-sponsored clinical studies on the safety and effectiveness of our products. We conduct these studies, in accordance with strict regulatory requirements, with \u201creal world\u201d physicians and their patients in order to learn more about our products and bring new medicines and vaccines to patients who need them. Once a product is approved for marketing, we continue to conduct studies to monitor ongoing safety and effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also engage with health care professionals through our Investigator Studies Program, whose mission is to advance the delivery of quality health care by supporting investigator-initiated original research that will enhance the understanding of disease entities and their treatment. This program is open to all academic and community-based physicians and researchers worldwide who are interested in conducting their own research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are committed to the discovery and development of important new drugs and vaccines through collaboration with scientific leaders from academic and scientific organizations around the world. Advice in the form of consulting engagements with external medical and scientific experts results in meaningful scientific exchanges that bring real-world knowledge and perspectives to our company. These critical exchanges contribute to advancing science both at our company and in the broader scientific community, and ultimately help benefit human health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also engage physicians as speakers in the U.S. through our company\u2019s Medical Forums, which are designed to deliver balanced medical and scientific information to health care professionals so that patients can have access to the medicines and vaccines they need and use these products correctly. These programs are structured to be consistent with the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals and are conducted in compliance with FDA regulations to help ensure that our product information is presented in an appropriately balanced manner, with respect to potential benefits and risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/openpaymentsdata.cms.gov\">Search Open Payments Data<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"corpberg-tab-content corpberg-tab-content-3\">\n<h3>Philanthropic grants and contributions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We report philanthropic grants and charitable contributions, including contributions made through the Office of Social Business Innovation, our company\u2019s Foundation, U.S. Global Human Health, and the <em>Merck for Mothers<\/em> program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All reports are intended for residents of the U.S. and Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2022\/08\/Q22022-Transparency-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report Q2 2022<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2022\/05\/Q12022-Transparency-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report Q1 2022<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2022\/02\/charitable-contributions-2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report 2021<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/07\/MSD-Charitable-2020-Full-Year-Transparency-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report 2020<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/07\/MSD-Charitable-2019-Full-Year-Transparency-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report 2019<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/07\/MSD-Charitable-2018-Transparency-Report-Final-Full-Year_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report 2018<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/07\/MSD_FINAL-Charitable-2017-Full_Year_Transparency_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charitable Contributions Report 2017<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"corpberg-tab-content corpberg-tab-content-4\">\n<h3>Post-marketing requirements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We recognize the importance of providing transparent information about the status of our marketing and development activities after a product has been approved by regulatory authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This information can help ensure that health care providers and patients remain informed about our products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To inform the public about post-marketing activities, we will, on a quarterly basis, post information on this website concerning post-marketing requirements (PMRs) for U.S.-marketed products intended for human use.
