Mutepfa knew vaccine clinical trials would be on the horizon. Because clinical trials are designed to learn how our bodies respond to treatments, like vaccines, it&#8217;s key that they include a diverse pool of participants. As a Black woman who\u2019s spent her career as a research health advocate, Kieta knew she had to get involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find a COVID-19 vaccine trial to join, Kieta started by researching clinical trial sites in her hometown of New Orleans. She repeatedly checked for updates. When a phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial began looking for volunteers, Kieta added her name to the list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A phase 3 clinical trial aims to find out if the vaccine works in a large number of people.  To make sure we understand the vaccine&#8217;s safety and effectiveness profile for everyone, it&#8217;s important that the trial include people of different ages, races, ethnic groups and genders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a recent stroke survivor, she&#8217;s also a patient with a chronic (long-term) health condition \u2013 another key group to include in vaccine trials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCOVID-19 has already gravely impacted the Black community,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt the reason I survived my stroke was so that others could live and learn. Joining a COVID-19 trial was my way of stepping in for every person that has died from COVID-19 and those at risk of dying.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A career dedicated to research<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining the COVID-19 vaccine trial was a no-brainer for Kieta, who\u2019s spent years as a health advocate and is passionate about ensuring diversity in clinical trials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During her career, she has done field research (research in the real world, outside of the lab) and worked to gain a better understanding of health care barriers for the Black community. Before joining Merck, Kieta worked at the UCLA Center for AIDS Research Education. More recently, she became a founding member of the global COVID Advocates Advisory Board. She also works with the Louisiana Community Engagement Alliance Advisory on COVID-19 awareness and education research, especially among Black Americans, Hispanics\/Latinos, and American Indians \u2014 populations that account for over half of all reported cases in the U.S.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of her vast health care and research experiences, Kieta knew that  joining a COVID-19 vaccine trial would have a great impact on people around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was scared and eager because the trials were so heavily in demand. Global interest was high among research advocates,\u201d she says. \u201cFriends and colleagues of mine in science were very interested in educating people about the new treatments that were being explored.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Following science and innovation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kieta remained confident, though, about taking part in a trial for the COVID-19 vaccine. She trusted the science.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"mco-f12-article-quote-block-block_6036c5ad386a6\" class=\"mco-f12-article-quote-block article-quote corporateberg-block mt-2 mb-2 wrapper-story-narrow\">\n        <div class=\"article-quote__image\">\n        <picture>\n            <source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/02\/kieta-quote-block.png?resize=321,196\">\n            <source media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1279px)\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/02\/kieta-quote-block.png?resize=656,296\">\n            <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/02\/kieta-quote-block.png?resize=404,340\">\n            <img\n                data-src=\"https:\/\/www.merck.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/5\/2021\/02\/kieta-quote-block.png?resize=404,340\"\n                alt=\"article quote image\"\n                class=\"lazyload\"\n                loading=\"lazy\"\n            \/>\n        <\/picture>\n    <\/div>\n        <div class=\"article-quote__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-content\">\n            \u201cIt\u2019s a whole process based on trust.

And, nurses took nine tubes of blood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI felt that they had a plan for every possible scenario \u2013 especially with Black trial participants,\u201d Kieta says. \u201cI think every possible scenario was thought of, discussed and given a lot of attention. There are a lot of the outside factors that the researchers and their teams have to consider.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kieta recently received her second COVID-19 vaccine. As part of the trial, researchers will check her health for another two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Raising trust and diversity in clinical trials<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a longtime research advocate, Kieta is proud to use her voice to impact people around the world. She also shares the company&#8217;s mission of saving and improving lives. She is doing her part to ensure that vaccine access and equity reaches people who represent diverse groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"mco-f12-article-quote-block-block_6036c4ee386a5\" class=\"mco-f12-article-quote-block article-quote corporateberg-block mb-2 mt-2 wrapper-story-narrower\">\n        <div class=\"article-quote__content\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-content\">\n            \u201cWe need to get more Black Americans in clinical trials, so we are better represented and can advocate for others in our community,&quot; she says.        <\/h2>\n        \n                <div class=\"title\">\n            <p>\n                <strong> <\/strong>\n            <\/p>\n            <small class=\"position\"> <\/small>\n        <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>Kieta often finds herself recalling what her fellow research advocate, Danielle Campbell, has said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we [Black people] are hard to find.
