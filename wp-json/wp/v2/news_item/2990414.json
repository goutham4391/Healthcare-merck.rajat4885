This agreement will help create broad access for molnupiravir use in 105 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following appropriate regulatory approvals. Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics are jointly developing molnupiravir.\n<\/p>\n<p id=\"news-body-cta\">This press release features multimedia.

Merck, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Emory University will not receive royalties for sales of molnupiravir under this agreement for as long as COVID-19 remains classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nCharles Gore, MPP, executive director, said, \u201cThe interim results for molnupiravir are compelling and we see this oral treatment candidate as a potentially important tool to help address the current health crisis. This transparent, public health-driven agreement is MPP\u2019s first voluntary license for a COVID-19 medical technology, and we hope that Merck\u2019s agreement with MPP will be a strong encouragement to others.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFrank Clyburn, executive vice president and president of Human Health, Merck, said, \u201cMerck\u2019s mission to save and improve lives is a truly global commitment. This agreement with MPP is another important element in our multi-faceted strategy to accelerate broad, affordable access to molnupiravir, if approved or authorized, for patients no matter where they live, including in countries where governments face greater challenges to finance healthcare.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nDr. Philippe Duneton, executive director, Unitaid, co-lead of the ACT-A Therapeutics Pillar, said, \u201cEffective, easy to administer, oral treatments that can help to reduce the risk for progression to severe illness may be an important tool to help get the pandemic under control. We encourage further efforts in voluntary licensing to ensure that people in low- and middle-income countries can access COVID-19 treatments once authorized by WHO or a stringent regulatory authority.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was invented at Emory University and licensed to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics by Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to advance the development of early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern. Emory received research funding from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nGregory L. Fenves, president, Emory University, said, \u201cThe license for molnupiravir to the Medicines Patent Pool will support global public health and address unmet medical needs \u2013 reflecting Emory\u2019s mission to serve humanity. Innovative research and collaboration across organizations have been vital in the fight against COVID-19.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nWendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, said, \u201cWe are pleased to collaborate with MPP to ensure that quality-assured generic versions of molnupiravir can be developed and distributed quickly following regulatory authorization.

Through its innovative business model, MPP partners with civil society, governments, international organizations, industry, patient groups, and other stakeholders, to prioritize and license needed medicines and pool intellectual property to encourage generic manufacture and the development of new formulations. To date, MPP has signed agreements with eleven patent holders for thirteen HIV antiretrovirals, one HIV technology platform, three hepatitis C direct-acting antivirals, a tuberculosis treatment, a long-acting technology and an experimental oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19. MPP was founded by Unitaid, which continues to be MPP\u2019s main funder. MPP\u2019s work on access to essential medicines is also funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).
