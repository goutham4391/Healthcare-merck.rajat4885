The MITT population included all participants who were randomly assigned, received at least one dose of study drug, and were not hospitalized before the first dose of study drug. Based on a post hoc analysis, fewer LAGEVRIO-treated participants in the MITT population required respiratory interventions (including conventional oxygen therapy, a high-flow heated and humidified device, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation) versus placebo-treated participants, with a RRR of 34.3% [95% CI, 4.3% to 54.9%] for all respiratory interventions. Based on additional post hoc analyses, participants in the safety population who received LAGEVRIO showed earlier and larger reductions in mean C-reactive protein (CRP) values, and earlier and larger improvements in mean change from baseline oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2<\/sub>) values, compared with participants who received placebo. The safety population consisted of all participants who had undergone randomization and had received at least one dose of LAGEVRIO.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPost hoc analyses also suggest that among the subgroup of participants who were hospitalized after randomization in MOVe-OUT, the median time to hospital discharge was nine days [CI, 7 to 12 days] for participants who received LAGEVRIO, versus 12 days [CI, 9 to 14 days] in the placebo group. Consistent with the full MITT population data, post hoc analyses also suggest that fewer LAGEVRIO-treated participants who were hospitalized after randomization required respiratory interventions versus placebo-treated participants, with a RRR of 21.3% [95% CI, 0.2% to 38.0%] for all respiratory interventions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cThe analyses add to our understanding of the clinical profile of LAGEVRIO and help to reinforce the importance of LAGEVRIO as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Dean Y.

LAGEVRIO is not FDA-approved for any use including for use for the treatment of COVID-19.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe emergency use of LAGEVRIO is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(b)(1) unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with LAGEVRIO has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. LAGEVRIO may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which LAGEVRIO belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Selected Safety Information for LAGEVRIO<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Contraindications<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNo contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO authorized under this EUA.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Warnings and Precautions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere is a pregnancy surveillance program that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of Merck\u2019s pregnancy surveillance program at 1-877-888-4231 or <a href=\"http:\/\/pregnancyreporting.msd.com\">pregnancyreporting.msd.com<\/a>. If the pregnant individual agrees to participate in the pregnancy surveillance program and allows the prescribing healthcare provider to disclose patient specific information to Merck, the prescribing healthcare provider must provide the patient\u2019s name and contact information to Merck. Pregnant individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO can also report the exposure by contacting Merck at 1-877-888-4231 or <a href=\"http:\/\/pregnancyreporting.msd.com\">pregnancyreporting.msd.com<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAdvise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPrior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and\/or supportive care.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO have not been established in pediatric patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Adverse Reactions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of subjects in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSerious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (&lt;1%) of the subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Drug Interactions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNo drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of LAGEVRIO with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Pregnancy\/Breastfeeding<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from LAGEVRIO, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of LAGEVRIO.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Males of Reproductive Potential<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for LAGEVRIO to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO.

Preclinical data has shown that LAGEVRIO has antiviral activity against the variant, Omicron (B1.1.529). LAGEVRIO has yet to be evaluated against Omicron in clinical studies.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory\/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. LAGEVRIO is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally.
