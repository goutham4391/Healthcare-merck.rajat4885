(now Viatris) related to sitagliptin dihydrogen phosphate, an active ingredient in JANUVIA<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> (sitagliptin), JANUMET<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride) and JANUMET<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> XR (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nViatris had challenged validity of U.S. Patent No.7,326,708 in an <i>inter partes<\/i> review before the U.S. Patent Office. On May 7, 2021, the Patent Office issued a decision in Merck\u2019s favor, finding all challenged claims valid. Viatris appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which today affirmed the decision.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nViatris had previously challenged validity of the patent in a case filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia.

The company has settled with multiple generic companies, providing that these generic companies can bring their sitagliptin dihydrogen phosphate or sitagliptin-metformin product to the market in May 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances, and their sitagliptin-metformin extended-release product to the market in July 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Merck<br \/>\n<br \/><\/b>At Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.
