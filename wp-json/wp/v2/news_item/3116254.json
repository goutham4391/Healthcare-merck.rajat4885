The Advisory Committee voted 13-10 that the known and potential benefits of molnupiravir outweigh its known and potential risks for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in high risk adult patients who are within five days of symptom onset. The FDA is not bound by the committee\u2019s guidance but takes its advice into consideration.\n<\/p>\n<p id=\"news-body-cta\">This press release features multimedia.

That is why we are moving with speed and rigor to pursue authorizations and to accelerate broad global access to this investigational medicine,\u201d said Dr. Dean Y. Li, executive vice president and president, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cWe are grateful to the members of the Advisory Committee who reviewed our application, as well as to the patients and investigators who participated in our clinical trials, and we will continue to work with the FDA as the agency completes its review.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cWe are one step closer to being able to add molnupiravir to the tools that we have \u2013 in addition to vaccines \u2013 that can be available and accessible to help fight COVID-19. Importantly, our data show activity against the most prevalent variants today, and molnupiravir was studied as a monotherapy with no drug-drug interactions observed to date. We will continue to work with urgency to bring this investigational medicine forward to appropriate patients,\u201d said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nUnder an EUA, to help strengthen the nation\u2019s protection against public health threats, such as SARS-CoV-2, the FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products in a public health emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain criteria are met, including when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.

MOVe-OUT evaluated molnupiravir in non-hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 with symptom onset within five days prior to randomization who were at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and\/or hospitalization. At the planned interim analysis, which based on the study design was the primary efficacy analysis of the study, treatment with molnupiravir significantly reduced hospitalizations and death through Day 29 following randomization: 14.1% (53\/377) of patients in the placebo group were hospitalized or died, compared to 7.3% (28\/385) of patients who received molnupiravir who were hospitalized; at the interim analysis, no patients who took molnupiravir died, compared to eight patients who received placebo. The absolute risk reduction between the molnupiravir and the placebo arm was 6.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4, 11.3; p=0.0012), which is approximately a 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death through Day 29 compared with placebo. The efficacy benefit with molnupiravir treatment was consistent across important patient subgroups, including patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, Delta, Gamma and Mu.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOn Nov. 26, Merck announced additional analyses from all enrolled participants (n=1433). In this population, molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from 9.7% in the placebo group (68\/699) to 6.8% (48\/709) in the molnupiravir group, for an absolute risk reduction of 3.0% (95% CI: 0.1, 5.9; nominal p-value=0.0218) and a relative risk reduction of 30% (relative risk 0.70; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.99). Nine deaths were reported in the placebo group, and one in the molnupiravir group.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAt the planned interim analysis, the incidence of any adverse event (AE) was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (35.0% and 39.6%, respectively). The incidence of drug-related AEs was also comparable (12.4% and 11.1%, respectively). Fewer subjects discontinued study therapy due to an AE in the molnupiravir group (1.3%) compared to the placebo group (3.4%). In the supportive analysis of all randomized patients, the AE profile for molnupiravir remained consistent with the profile reported at the planned interim analysis.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Molnupiravir<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir (MK-4482 and EIDD-2801) is an investigational, orally administered form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Pre-clinical data suggest that molnupiravir has a high barrier to the development of resistance.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is being studied as a single medicine, without the use of concomitant medicines and without food intake restrictions or dose modifications based on renal or hepatic impairment. Based on available data, no known drug interactions with molnupiravir have been identified.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was invented at Drug Innovations at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, a not-for-profit biotechnology company wholly owned by Emory University; Emory\/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is also being evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in MOVe-AHEAD, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households.
