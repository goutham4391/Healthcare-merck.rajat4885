Merck has saved and improved lives around the world for more than 130 years, and we remain committed to doing so. Any profits resulting from these sales will be donated to humanitarian causes. We will maintain scientific exchange of information with stakeholders in critical therapeutic areas. However, the company will not make further investments&nbsp;in Russia. This includes stopping all promotional activities, capital investments and business development initiatives. Additionally, screening and enrollment in ongoing clinical trials, and planning for new studies in Russia have been suspended. We are continuing to treat patients already enrolled in existing clinical trials and collect data from these studies underway, and we are working hard to ensure no patient is left behind. Merck does not have research or manufacturing facilities in Russia and is operating in compliance with all international sanctions while working to ensure continued access to essential medicines and vaccines. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this tragic time, Merck\u2019s commitment to helping the people affected is unwavering. We are using our resources to help alleviate the human suffering in Ukraine. Merck and MSD are taking various actions to address the humanitarian crisis, which include the:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Delivery of molnupiravir to Ukraine through a supply and purchase agreement we have with the government.<\/li><li>Donation of molnupiravir to Direct Relief for distribution to refugees. We are preparing to donate additional courses specifically for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine.<\/li><li>Donation of product, including PROVENTIL, an inhaler used in patients with asthma, TIENAM IV (marketed as PRIMAXIN in the U.S.), an antibiotic used to treat infections in hospitalized patients, and KEYTRUDA for existing patients in need. We are actively assessing needs for additional products.<\/li><li>Commitment of $1 million USD directed to humanitarian partners, American Red Cross, Direct Relief, International Medical Corps and Project HOPE, delivering urgent assistance to those affected in the region.<\/li><li>Utilization of our donation program for U.S. and Puerto Rico employees to donate to Ukraine relief efforts. Contributions will be matched 100% by the company. Employees outside of the U.S. can receive a company match toward their donation to the Red Cross and Direct Relief, and the contribution will be matched 100% by the company.<\/li><li>Donation of vaccines from Merck Animal Health to farmers in Ukraine to support the continued raising of livestock and food production.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As of March 28, our total cash and product donations amount to more than $65 million USD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merck will continue to monitor this tragedy and update its response as this crisis unfolds. The focus now remains on supporting the well-being of our employees, doing what we can to ensure access to our medicines and vaccines, and further using our resources to alleviate the unimaginable human suffering in Ukraine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Merck<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For over 130 years, Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world\u2019s most challenging diseases in pursuit of our mission to save and improve lives.
