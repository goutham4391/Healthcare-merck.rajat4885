Among study participants for whom samples were available, viral infectivity was assessed via a plaque-forming assay in Vero cells. Prespecified exploratory virologic outcomes included changes from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, and the percentage of study participants with viral clearance (i.e., undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA) and undetectable infectious SARS-CoV-2 through Day 29 in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (\u22651 dose of study intervention and not hospitalized prior to first dose).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn participants with infectious virus isolated at baseline and for whom post-baseline infectivity data were available, molnupiravir was associated with more rapid elimination of infectious virus than placebo. At Day 3 of treatment, among patients with infectious virus at baseline, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 0.0% (n=0\/92) of patients who received LAGEVRIO, compared with 20.8% (n=20\/96) of patients who received placebo. At Day 5, infectious virus was detected in 0.0% (n=0\/91) of patients in the LAGEVRIO arm compared with 2.2% (n=2\/89) in the placebo arm. At Day 10, no infectious virus was detected in either arm for patients with infectious virus at baseline. Molnupiravir was also associated with greater mean reductions from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA than placebo from Days 3 through 10, though molnupiravir and placebo were associated with comparable rates of viral RNA clearance through Day 29.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cIn these exploratory analyses from our Phase 3 study in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, LAGEVRIO, an investigational oral antiviral medicine, cleared infectious SARS-CoV-2 faster than placebo among patients who had infectious virus at baseline, resulting in no infectious virus detected at Day 3, 5 or 10,\u201d said Jay Grobler, associate vice president, infectious diseases and vaccines, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cThese data reinforce our confidence in the potential of LAGEVRIO as a part of the solution to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cWe are encouraged by these data, which are consistent with findings from the Ridgeback Bio sponsored Phase 2 trial. These additional data will help to strengthen the base of scientific knowledge around LAGEVRIO as a treatment option for mild to moderate COVID-19 in appropriate patients,\u201d said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to study LAGEVRIO to build our understanding with the goal of helping high-risk patients around the world.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAdditional molnupiravir data to be presented at ECCMID include:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n&#8211; Abstract #4865: Effects of Molnupiravir on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome: Next-Generation Sequencing Data from the MOVe-OUT Phase 3 Trial.

LAGEVRIO is not FDA-approved for any use including for use for the treatment of COVID-19.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe emergency use of molnupiravir is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(b)(1) unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with LAGEVRIO has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. LAGEVRIO may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which LAGEVRIO belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Selected Safety Information for LAGEVRIO<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Contraindications<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNo contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO authorized under this EUA.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Warnings and Precautions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere is a pregnancy surveillance program that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of Merck\u2019s pregnancy surveillance program at 1-877-888-4231 or <a href=\"http:\/\/pregnancyreporting.msd.com\">pregnancyreporting.msd.com<\/a>. If the pregnant individual agrees to participate in the pregnancy surveillance program and allows the prescribing healthcare provider to disclose patient specific information to Merck, the prescribing healthcare provider must provide the patient\u2019s name and contact information to Merck. Pregnant individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO can also report the exposure by contacting Merck at 1-877-888-4231 or <a href=\"http:\/\/pregnancyreporting.msd.com\">pregnancyreporting.msd.com<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAdvise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPrior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and\/or supportive care.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO have not been established in pediatric patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Adverse Reactions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of subjects in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSerious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (&lt;1%) of the subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Drug Interactions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNo drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of LAGEVRIO with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Pregnancy\/Breastfeeding<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from LAGEVRIO, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of LAGEVRIO.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Males of Reproductive Potential<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for LAGEVRIO to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO. The risk beyond three months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO is unknown.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe prescribing healthcare provider and\/or the provider\u2019s designee is\/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to LAGEVRIO within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider\u2019s awareness of the event.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSubmit adverse event and medication error reports, using FDA Form 3500, to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nComplete and submit the report online: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch%2Freport.htm&amp;esheet=52639138&amp;newsitemid=20220401005097&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch%2Freport.htm&amp;index=6&amp;md5=8da61a6005218e033a950b3383a176cd\" shape=\"rect\">www.fda.gov\/medwatch\/report.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\nComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F76299%2Fdownload&amp;esheet=52639138&amp;newsitemid=20220401005097&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F76299%2Fdownload&amp;index=7&amp;md5=509454e1429142ee8c40ee9d06703a8d\" shape=\"rect\">https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/76299\/download<\/a>) and return by:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\">\n<li>\nMail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, or\n<\/li>\n<li>\nFax to 1-800-FDA-0178\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\nCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting form\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\nIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to:\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ USA by:<br \/>\n<br \/>Fax: 215-616-5677<br \/>\n<br \/>E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:dpoc.usa@merck.com\" shape=\"rect\">dpoc.usa@merck.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About LAGEVRIO<sup><\/sup>(molnupiravir)<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nLAGEVRIO<sup><\/sup>(molnupiravir) (MK-4482) is an investigational, orally administered nucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck and Ridgeback\u2019s \u201corange COVID-19 pill\u201d is a Swedish Orange opaque capsule with the Merck corporate logo and \u201c82\u201d printed in white ink, available in certain markets as LAGEVRIO.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nResults from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT study demonstrated the efficacy benefit of LAGEVRIO treatment was generally consistent across patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, Delta, Gamma and Mu.
