Remaining Scope 1 emissions will be offset each year with a portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including carbon removals.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cGlobal efforts to combat climate change are essential to the health and sustainability of our planet,\u201d said Robert Davis, president, Merck. \u201cOur new climate action goals reflect our ongoing commitment to operating responsibly and will help us drive long-term sustainability for our business, society and for the patients and communities we serve.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>New Virtual Power Purchase Agreements Signed<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck is also accelerating by 15 years its previous 2040 goal to source 100% renewable energy for its purchased electricity. Merck signed three new virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for utility-scale energy projects based in Texas and Spain. These projects will address approximately 35% of Merck\u2019s Scope 2 emissions by collectively adding 145 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind energy to the grid. Merck previously signed a U.S. wind VPPA in 2018, which has added 60 MW of new renewable energy capacity, while providing Merck with the associated renewable energy credits.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nTo achieve the 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030, Merck will continue to engage with its suppliers to reduce their emissions, promote opportunities for suppliers to source renewable energy, and use existing procurement and supply chain processes to drive additional strategies to decrease emissions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cAt Merck, we are focused on adopting innovative ways to reduce emissions, in our own operations and across our entire value chain,\u201d said Jennifer Zachary, executive vice president and general counsel, who is also responsible for the company\u2019s global safety and environment function. \u201cOur new VPPA agreements and ongoing engagement with suppliers reflect our responsible use of resources in every aspect of our work.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck has a long-standing commitment to environmental sustainability. The new commitments expand on Merck\u2019s most recent goals and priorities set in 2017 that focus on driving efficiency in its operations, designing new products to minimize environmental impact, and reducing the impacts in its value chain.
