This action follows the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), after the DMC reviewed the data from a planned interim analysis. LYNPARZA is a PARP inhibitor that is being co-developed and co-commercialized with AstraZeneca.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the pre-specified interim analysis for progression-free survival, the efficacy of LYNPARZA as a monotherapy and in combination with bevacizumab relative to control met the criteria for futility by the DMC and accordingly, both experimental arms will be discontinued. No new safety signals were observed with LYNPARZA in this trial, and the safety profiles of both LYNPARZA monotherapy and LYNPARZA combined with bevacizumab in this trial were generally consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Merck will inform study investigators of the recommendation from the DMC and will advise patients in the trial to speak to their physician regarding treatment options. Data from this study will be shared in a future scientific forum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LYNK-003 is one of several trials initiated by Merck as part of the extensive LYNPARZA clinical development program. In addition to colorectal cancer, LYNPARZA is also being studied by Merck, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, as both monotherapy and in new combinations across a range of DNA damage response deficient tumor types, including metastatic prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About LYNK-003<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LYNK-003 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04456699\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NCT04456699<\/a>) evaluating LYNPARZA in combination with bevacizumab and as monotherapy compared to bevacizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in 309 patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer who had not progressed following first-line induction. The primary endpoint is PFS, and secondary endpoints include OS, objective response rate, duration of response and safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Colorectal Cancer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or the rectum, and these cancers are referred to as colon cancer or rectal cancer depending on where the cancer starts. Colorectal cancer often begins with growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps, which can change into cancer over time. Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer death, with 1,932,000 new cases diagnosed and 935,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. In the United States, it is estimated there will be more than 106,000 new cases of colon cancer and nearly 45,000 new cases of rectal cancer diagnosed, and nearly 53,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About LYNPARZA<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> (olaparib)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as <em>BRCA<\/em> mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad and advanced clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CONTRAINDICATIONS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Myelodysplastic Syndrome\/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS\/AML): <\/strong>Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS\/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and\/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (\u2264Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS\/AML is confirmed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pneumonitis: <\/strong>Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: <\/strong>Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Females<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Males<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Venous Thromboembolic Events:<\/strong> Including pulmonary embolism, occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS\u2014First-Line Maintenance <em>BRCA<\/em>m Advanced Ovarian Cancer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in \u226510% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the <strong>first-line maintenance setting<\/strong> for <strong>SOLO-1 <\/strong>were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection\/influenza\/nasopharyngitis\/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in \u226525% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the <strong>first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1<\/strong> were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ADVERSE REACTIONS\u2014First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with Bevacizumab<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in \u226510% of patients treated with LYNPARZA\/bevacizumab compared to a \u22655% frequency for placebo\/bevacizumab in the <strong>first-line maintenance setting<\/strong> for <strong>PAOLA-1<\/strong> were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%) and leukopenia (18%).
