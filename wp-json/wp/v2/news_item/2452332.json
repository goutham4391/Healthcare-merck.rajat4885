The funds are being provided by Merck and will be administered through an application process managed by the MDP, a public-private partnership that oversees elimination efforts of these two diseases.

After months of careful assessment, in July, WHO released a decision-making framework for resuming MDA during the ongoing pandemic. The framework is based on a two-step approach: a risk\u2013benefit assessment to decide if the planned activity should proceed; and, if activities move forward, a list of precautionary measures that should be applied to help decrease the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and strengthen the capacity of the health system to manage any residual risk. These important precautionary measures will result in an increase in program costs, which may be a burden to some countries and their implementing partners.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is especially challenging for communities that continue to be threatened by river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. We can\u2019t lose momentum and must strengthen our global partnerships to eliminate these infections,\u201d said Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, chief patient officer at Merck. \u201cWe hope these grants will help sustain the implementation of good public health measures and protect people\u2019s safety as they fight against these preventable diseases during this especially difficult time.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nDr. Yao Sodahlon, MDP Director, stated &#8220;As the global community continues to battle the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we remain committed to the health of our staff, the health of our partners, and the health of endemic communities. This grant opportunity will facilitate the implementation of robust safety measures when mass drug administration with MECTIZAN resumes.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThrough the MDP and its partners &#8212; including the ministries of health in endemic countries, impacted communities, NGOs, WHO, and donors &#8212; more than 300 million people are reached each year. Since the inception of the program in 1987, Merck has donated more than 4 billion treatments.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMore information on the eligibility and the application process can be found on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mectizan.org%2F&amp;esheet=52310518&amp;newsitemid=20201022005039&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=MDP+website&amp;index=1&amp;md5=e851bd07aa9606899a56e5c52f29e667\" shape=\"rect\">MDP website<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Merck<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFor more than 125 years, Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world\u2019s most challenging diseases in pursuit of our mission to save and improve lives.

In 1998, MDP expanded its mandate to include the donation of MECTIZAN to be distributed in conjunction with albendazole (donated by GSK) for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in onchocerciasis co-endemic areas. In 2017, MDP\u2019s mandate was subsequently expanded to include MECTIZAN donation for the implementation of the WHO recommended triple therapy (Ivermectin + Diethylcarbamazine + Albendazole or IDA) to accelerate the elimination of LF in countries where river blindness is not endemic.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Forward-Looking Statement of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThis news release of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA (the \u201ccompany\u201d) includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
