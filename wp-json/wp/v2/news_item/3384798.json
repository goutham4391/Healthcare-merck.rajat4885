Molnupiravir has not been approved, but has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an EUA to treat mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. Molnupiravir is not authorized for use in patients who are less than 18 years of age, for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, for use for longer than five consecutive days, or for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19.\n<\/p>\n<p id=\"news-body-cta\">This press release features multimedia.

Because we recognized the promise of molnupiravir early, Merck invested at risk and we are executing an unprecedented global access strategy so that molnupiravir, now authorized, can be available to patients here in the U.S. and all around the world more quickly and more equitably than has ever been accomplished before,\u201d said Robert M. Davis, chief executive officer and president, Merck.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir should be administered as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within five days of symptom onset. The recommended dose for molnupiravir is 800 mg (four 200 mg capsules) taken orally every 12 hours for five days, with or without food. Completion of the full five-day treatment course is important to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is not recommended for use in patients who are pregnant. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, molnupiravir may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of molnupiravir in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Before initiating treatment with molnupiravir, it should be assessed whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated. Females of childbearing potential should use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently, as applicable, for the duration of treatment and for four days after the last dose of molnupiravir. Males of reproductive potential who are sexually active with females of childbearing potential should use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least three months after the last dose. There is a pregnancy surveillance program that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to molnupiravir during pregnancy. Patients exposed to molnupiravir during pregnancy should report the exposure by contacting Merck by phone at 1-877-888-4231, or online at pregnancyreporting.msd.com. For more information, see \u201cSelected Safety Information\u201d below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe authorization is based on the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial, which evaluated molnupiravir 800 mg twice-daily in non-hospitalized adult patients who were unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptom onset within five days of study randomization, and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes (e.g., heart disease, diabetes).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgeback-biotherapeutics-provide-update-on-results-from-move-out-study-of-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-medicine-in-at-risk-adults-with-mild-to-moderate-covid-19%2F&amp;esheet=52555325&amp;newsitemid=20211223005322&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=analyses&amp;index=1&amp;md5=966a08b4923242a1699599e48d976587\" shape=\"rect\">analyses<\/a> from all randomized patients (n=1433), molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death: 9.7% (68\/699) of patients in the placebo group were hospitalized or died compared to 6.8% (48\/709) of patients who received molnupiravir, for an absolute risk reduction of 3.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1, 5.9).

At the interim analysis, treatment with molnupiravir significantly reduced hospitalizations and death through Day 29 following randomization: 14.1% (53\/377) of patients in the placebo group were hospitalized or died, compared to 7.3% (28\/385) of patients who received molnupiravir. The absolute risk reduction between the molnupiravir and the placebo arm was 6.8 percentage points (95% CI: 2.4, 11.3; p=0.0024).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the clinical study, the most common adverse reactions for molnupiravir (incidence \u22651%) were diarrhea (2% for molnupiravir, 2% for placebo), nausea (1% for molnupiravir, 1% for placebo) and dizziness (1% for molnupiravir, 1% for placebo). Discontinuation of study intervention due to an adverse event (AE) occurred in 1% of subjects receiving molnupiravir and 3% of subjects receiving placebo. Serious AEs occurred in 7% of subjects receiving molnupiravir and 10% receiving placebo; most serious AEs were COVID-19 related.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cBased on the strong science behind molnupiravir \u2013 a single oral medicine that interrupts replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with data demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalizations and deaths \u2013 molnupiravir has the potential to become an important tool for healthcare professionals and appropriate patients,\u201d said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cWe are immensely grateful to all of our collaborators, including trial patients and clinical investigators, for their important contributions to this milestone.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck anticipates that it will begin shipping molnupiravir to AmerisourceBergen, the sole distributor of molnupiravir, within days.

We joined with George Painter, Drug Research Innovations at Emory (DRIVE) and Merck with the hope of taking molnupiravir from a dream to the reality we see today,\u201d said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. \u201cThere is now a prescription oral antiviral, molnupiravir, for use by appropriate high-risk patients, that can be taken at home, as soon as possible after an appropriate patient tests positive for COVID-19, to help reduce the risk of hospitalization or death. It\u2019s an oral therapeutic option with no known drug-drug interactions and without required dose modifications for those with impaired kidney or liver function. We are thrilled this tremendous global collaboration between Ridgeback, Merck and DRIVE has fulfilled our hopes of bringing forward an oral medicine to help keep people out of the hospital and alive.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is also being evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in MOVe-AHEAD, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households. Molnupiravir is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAn EUA is an FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product in the U.S. under certain circumstances, including a public health emergency.

Molnupiravir has yet to be evaluated against Omicron in clinical studies.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory\/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPlease visit the Merck <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fmedia%2Four-investigational-covid-19-antiviral%2F&amp;esheet=52555325&amp;newsitemid=20211223005322&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=media+library&amp;index=12&amp;md5=7cf49e16d9dd8981be893d9683835c5f\" shape=\"rect\">media library<\/a> for molnupiravir images and b-roll.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Ridgeback Biotherapeutics<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nHeadquartered in Miami, Florida, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP is a biotechnology company focused on emerging infectious diseases.
