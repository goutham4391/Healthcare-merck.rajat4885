This temporary pause has been implemented out of an abundance of caution, to allow the companies to consider potential protocol adjustments to the trial in light of Merck\u2019s announcement on November 18 regarding the decision to stop dosing in the Phase 2 IMAGINE-DR clinical trial (MK-8591-013) evaluating the once-weekly combination of MK-8507 and islatravir. The companies remain optimistic about the future potential of the islatravir and lenacapavir combination regimen to provide a once-weekly oral therapy option for people living with HIV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants currently enrolled in this trial will continue to receive the study drug and be monitored per the current protocol. Clinical investigators have been informed of this action and will be notified as soon as any potential protocol adjustments are made.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gilead and Merck remain committed to the collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize long-acting treatments in HIV that combine Gilead\u2019s investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, and Merck\u2019s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, islatravir, as we work to develop new treatment options to address the unmet needs for people living with HIV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenacapavir and islatravir, alone and in combination, are investigational and not approved for use. Their safety and efficacy have not yet been established.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>About NCT05052996<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Phase 2, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the safety and antiviral effect of an oral weekly regimen of islatravir in combination with lenacapavir in virologically suppressed people aged 18 years and older with HIV. The study is being conducted at 25 sites in the United States.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the current trial protocol, 75 participants who meet all eligibility criteria are randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral weekly islatravir (20 mg) administered with oral lenacapavir (300 mg) on day 8 following a loading dose of islatravir (40 mg) and lenacapavir (600 mg) on days 1 and 2 or oral daily B\/F\/TAF (bictegravir 50 mg\/emtricitabine 200 mg\/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg tablets). Participants receive study drugs for 48 weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following completion of the Week 48 visit, participants in Treatment Group 1 will continue to receive an oral weekly regimen of islatravir in combination with oral lenacapavir. Participants in Treatment Group 2 will switch from daily oral B\/F\/TAF tablets to an oral weekly regimen of islatravir in combination with oral lenacapavir (starting with the loading doses over 2 days) and continue the study with visits every 12 weeks thereafter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For further information, please see: <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT05052996\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT05052996<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>About Lenacapavir<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenacapavir is Gilead\u2019s potential first-in-class, investigational long-acting HIV-1 capsid inhibitor in development for the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Lenacapavir&#8217;s multi-stage mechanism of action is distinguishable from currently approved classes of antiviral agents and is designed to provide a new avenue for the development of long-acting therapy options for people living with or at risk for HIV-1. While most antivirals act on just one stage of viral replication, lenacapavir is designed to inhibit HIV-1 at multiple stages of its lifecycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>About Islatravir (MK-8591)<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Islatravir (MK-8591) is Merck\u2019s investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor under evaluation in more than 10 clinical trials. For treatment, islatravir is being evaluated in combination with other antiretrovirals, including the ILLUMINATE clinical trials program for a once-daily regimen. In the IMPOWER clinical trials, islatravir is also being studied for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV-1 infection as a single agent across a variety of formulations, including an oral once-monthly regimen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>About Gilead Sciences<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gilead Sciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that has pursued and achieved breakthroughs in medicine for more than three decades, with the goal of creating a healthier world for all people.
