Molnupiravir is not FDA-approved for any use including for use for the treatment of COVID-19. Prior to initiating treatment with molnupiravir, carefully consider the known and potential risks and benefits.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of molnupiravir under section 564(b)(1) of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or who are hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with molnupiravir has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. Molnupiravir is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. Molnupiravir is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. Molnupiravir may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which molnupiravir belongs (i.e., anti-infectives).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Selected Safety Information for Molnupiravir<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Contraindications<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNo contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of molnupiravir authorized under this EUA.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Warnings and Precautions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are limited clinical data available for molnupiravir. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with molnupiravir use.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, molnupiravir may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of molnupiravir in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use molnupiravir during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using molnupiravir during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere is a pregnancy surveillance program that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to molnupiravir during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of Merck\u2019s pregnancy surveillance program at 1-877-888-4231 or pregnancyreporting.msd.com. If the pregnant individual agrees to participate in the pregnancy surveillance program and allows the prescribing healthcare provider to disclose patient specific information to Merck, the prescribing healthcare provider must provide the patient\u2019s name and contact information to Merck. Pregnant individuals exposed to molnupiravir can also report the exposure by contacting Merck at 1-877-888-4231 or pregnancyreporting.msd.com.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAdvise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with molnupiravir and for 4 days after the final dose.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPrior to initiating treatment with molnupiravir, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of molnupiravir have not been established in pediatric patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Adverse Reactions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of subjects in the molnupiravir treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSerious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving molnupiravir and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (&lt;1%) of the subjects receiving molnupiravir and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Drug Interactions<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNo drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of molnupiravir. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of molnupiravir with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Pregnancy\/Breastfeeding<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThere are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from molnupiravir, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with molnupiravir and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of molnupiravir.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Males of Reproductive Potential<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nNonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for molnupiravir to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after last dose of molnupiravir. The risk beyond three months after the last dose of molnupiravir is unknown.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe prescribing healthcare provider and\/or the provider\u2019s designee are\/is responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to molnupiravir within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider\u2019s awareness of the event.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nSubmit adverse event and medication error reports, using FDA Form 3500, to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nComplete and submit the report online: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch%2Freport.htm&amp;esheet=52570373&amp;newsitemid=20220128005096&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.fda.gov%2Fmedwatch%2Freport.htm&amp;index=7&amp;md5=6267dee9689ebac7c421d9fab4b7811e\" shape=\"rect\">www.fda.gov\/medwatch\/report.htm<\/a><\/li>\n<li>\nComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F76299%2Fdownload&amp;esheet=52570373&amp;newsitemid=20220128005096&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fmedia%2F76299%2Fdownload&amp;index=8&amp;md5=cf1d2663c3b3b734feac95dd053e3239\" shape=\"rect\">https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/76299\/download<\/a>) and return by:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bwlistcircle\">\n<li>\nMail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, or\n<\/li>\n<li>\nFax to 1-800-FDA-0178\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\nCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting form\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"bwmarginl1\">\nIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to:\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"bwmarginl2\">\nMerck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ USA by:<br \/>\n<br \/>Fax: 215-616-5677<br \/>\n<br \/>E-mail: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:dpoc.usa@merck.com\" shape=\"rect\">dpoc.usa@merck.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Molnupiravir<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir (MK-4482) is an investigational, orally administered nucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck and Ridgeback\u2019s \u201corange COVID-19 pill\u201d is a Swedish Orange opaque capsule with the Merck corporate logo and \u201c82\u201d printed in white ink, available in certain markets outside of the U.S. as LAGEVRIO<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nResults from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT study demonstrated the efficacy benefit of molnupiravir treatment was generally consistent across patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, Delta, Gamma and Mu.
