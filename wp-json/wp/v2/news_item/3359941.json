The European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive scientific opinion for molnupiravir under Article 5.3 Regulation 726\/2004, which is intended to support national decision-making on the possible use of molnupiravir prior to marketing authorization. Regulatory applications are under review or are in the process of being submitted, including applications for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cIn MOVe-OUT, molnupiravir significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization and death among a diverse population of patients at risk for more severe COVID-19. The increases in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths being reported globally are a stark reminder that new tools are urgently needed, which is why we are moving with speed and rigor to obtain authorizations and to accelerate broad global access to this investigational medicine for appropriate patients,\u201d said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cImportantly, we observed consistent efficacy among patients with more common variants at the time, and more recent preclinical evidence indicates that molnupiravir has antiviral activity against Omicron, which is encouraging considering the uncertain future of a rapidly evolving virus such as SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cThe publication of these positive results in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine<\/i> demonstrates that molnupiravir, which was studied as a single medicine that can be taken at home \u2013 regardless of food intake, with no known drug-drug interactions and without required dose modifications for those with kidney or liver impairment \u2013 has the potential to be a valuable addition to the therapeutic options available to fight COVID-19,\u201d said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. \u201cWe are grateful for the efforts of the clinical trial participants and investigators and will continue to study molnupiravir for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cOne of the hallmarks of the MOVe-OUT study is the diverse patient population, which included adults from 20 countries, with one or more risk factors such as obesity, advanced age, diabetes and serious heart conditions. Based on this study, molnupiravir has the potential to have a meaningful impact for patients, healthcare systems and public health,\u201d said Dr. Monica Gomes, Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1, Brazil.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About the MOVe-OUT Study<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe MOVe-OUT trial (MK-4482-002) (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04575597%3Fterm%3Dmolnupiravir%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&amp;esheet=52552492&amp;newsitemid=20211216006079&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=NCT04575597&amp;index=3&amp;md5=8a5991ca48888f97c41e6e3f8b30c658\" shape=\"rect\">NCT04575597<\/a>) was a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19. The primary efficacy objective of MOVe-OUT is to evaluate the efficacy of molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily for five days compared to placebo as assessed by the percentage of patients who are hospitalized and\/or die through Day 29.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPatients enrolled in the study had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes (age &gt;60 years; active cancer; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; obesity; serious heart conditions; or diabetes mellitus), and symptom onset within five days prior to study enrollment. Key exclusion criteria were an anticipated need for hospitalization for COVID-19 within the next 48 hours, dialysis or estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2<\/sup>, unwillingness to use contraception during the intervention period and for at least 4 days after completion of the regimen, severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count of &lt;500 per milliliter), platelet count below 100,000 per microliter, any prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and pregnancy. The potential impact of molnupiravir on fetal development if taken during pregnancy is unknown. Standard-of-care treatment with antipyretic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, glucocorticoids, or a combination was permitted; use of therapies intended as COVID-19 treatments (including any monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir) was prohibited through Day 29.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn the all randomized analysis, 47.7% of patients had onset of signs or symptoms three days or less before randomization and 44.5% had moderate COVID-19. The most common risk factors were obesity (73.7%), age over 60 years (17.2%) and diabetes mellitus (15.9%). Presence of baseline SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies was assessed centrally using the Elecsys<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> assay. Positive baseline SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, indicating recent\/prior infection (not vaccination), were reported for 19.8% of patients. Due to the ongoing nature of testing, the viral variant type at baseline was not available for 25.9% of randomized patients in the interim analysis sample and 44.7% of randomized patients in the all randomized sample at the time of the publication.&nbsp;Among the all randomized population with sequence data available (55.3%), the three most common SARS-CoV-2 variants were Delta (58.1%), Mu (20.5%) and Gamma (10.7%).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat%2F&amp;esheet=52552492&amp;newsitemid=20211216006079&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Positive+top-line+results&amp;index=4&amp;md5=ea5c76225ba94a92c123d5b65296ddd6\" shape=\"rect\">Positive top-line results<\/a> from the interim analysis were previously announced on Oct. 1, and recruitment into the study was stopped early at the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the FDA. At the interim analysis, which was the primary analysis timepoint of the study, superiority was demonstrated as treatment with molnupiravir reduced hospitalizations and death: 14.1% (53\/377) of patients in the placebo group were hospitalized or died, compared to 7.3% (28\/385) of patients who received molnupiravir who were hospitalized; at the interim analysis, no patients who took molnupiravir died through Day 29, compared to eight patients who received placebo. The absolute risk reduction was 6.8 percentage points (95% CI: 2.4, 11.3; p=0.001, one-sided), which is approximately a 50% relative reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death through Day 29 for molnupiravir compared with placebo. In the all randomized analysis (n=1433), molnupiravir had a lower risk of hospitalization or death through Day 29: 9.7% (68\/699) of patients in the placebo group compared to 6.8% (48\/709) of patients in the molnupiravir group, for an absolute risk reduction of 3.0% (95% CI: 0.1, 5.9) and a relative risk reduction of 30%. The efficacy benefit with molnupiravir treatment was generally consistent across important patient subgroups, including patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, Delta, Gamma and Mu. Nine deaths were reported in the placebo group (29-day all-cause mortality rate of 1.3%) and one in the molnupiravir group (29-day all-cause mortality rate of 0.1%), representing a relative reduction in the risk of death of 89% (95% CI: 14, 99).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAs in previous trials, no safety concerns with molnupiravir were identified, and there was no evidence of a pattern of clinically meaningful abnormalities in laboratory test results. The incidence of any adverse event (AE) was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (30.4% and 33.0%, respectively). The incidence of drug-related AEs was also comparable (8.0% and 8.4%, respectively), and a lower percentage of patients in the molnupiravir group discontinued therapy due to an AE compared to the placebo group (1.4% and 2.9%, respectively). Serious AEs, none of which were deemed drug-related by the investigator, were less frequently reported among patients treated with molnupiravir. Through Day 29, one death was reported in patients who received molnupiravir, as compared to nine deaths in the placebo arm. After Day 29, three additional deaths resulting from adverse events occurred in the placebo group compared with one additional death reported in the molnupiravir group.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Merck\u2019s Global Efforts to Accelerate Access to Molnupiravir Following Regulatory Authorizations or Approvals<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nGlobal access has been a priority for Merck and Ridgeback since the inception of their molnupiravir collaboration.

Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Pre-clinical data suggest that molnupiravir has a high barrier to the development of resistance.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is being studied as a single medicine (i.e., without the need for concomitant antiviral medicines). Based on available data, no food intake restrictions or dose modifications based on renal or hepatic impairment are necessary, and no known drug interactions with molnupiravir have been identified.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory\/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was evaluated in MOVe-OUT, a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally in more than 170 sites in locations including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.
