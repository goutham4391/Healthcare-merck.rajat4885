Li, executive vice president and president, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cWe believe that molnupiravir will be an important addition to the range of public health tools to fight COVID-19 \u2013 including the vaccines developed by the research-based pharmaceutical industry, which remain essential and are the first-line of defense against this pandemic.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe submission is based on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=positive+results+from+a+planned+interim+analysis&amp;index=2&amp;md5=30e3fea85fd7f56eff2ebfbb2c8e9bee\" shape=\"rect\">positive results from a planned interim analysis<\/a> from the Phase 3 MOVe-OUT clinical trial, which evaluated molnupiravir in non-hospitalized adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and\/or hospitalization. At the interim analysis, molnupiravir 800 mg twice-daily reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50%; 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were hospitalized through Day 29 following randomization (28\/385), compared with 14.1% of placebo-treated patients (53\/377) that were either hospitalized or died; p=0.0012. Through Day 29, no deaths were reported in patients who received molnupiravir, as compared to 8 deaths in patients who received placebo. The incidence of any adverse event was comparable in the molnupiravir and placebo groups (35% and 40%, respectively). The incidence of drug-related adverse events was also comparable (12% and 11%, respectively), and fewer patients in the molnupiravir group discontinued therapy due to an adverse event compared to the placebo group (1.3% and 3.4%, respectively).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\u201cIn the nearly two years since COVID-19 emerged, the global scientific community has made extraordinary strides in developing several critical vaccines and treatments, but we still have a need for an oral antiviral medicine that can be taken at home,\u201d said Wendy Holman, chief executive officer, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. \u201cWe believe that molnupiravir, with the exciting finding of reduction in hospitalization and death in the MOVe-OUT study, may help fill that need and look forward to working with the EMA on its review.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>About Merck\u2019s Efforts to Enable Global Access to Molnupiravir, if it is Granted Authorization or Approval<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>\nIn anticipation of the results from MOVe-OUT and the potential for regulatory authorization or approval, Merck has been producing molnupiravir at risk and expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with even more courses expected to be produced in 2022.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nOn October 11, Merck and Ridgeback <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/cts.businesswire.com\/ct\/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.merck.com%2Fnews%2Fmerck-and-ridgeback-announce-submission-of-emergency-use-authorization-application-to-the-u-s-fda-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-medicine-for-the-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-c%2F&amp;esheet=52514379&amp;newsitemid=20211025005204&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=announced&amp;index=3&amp;md5=9ff2d69fb5913eb83fe56671b065fcc2\" shape=\"rect\">announced<\/a> that Merck had submitted an application for EUA to the U.S. FDA for molnupiravir for the treatment of at-risk adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Molnupiravir has been shown to be active in several preclinical models of SARS-CoV-2, including for prophylaxis, treatment, and prevention of transmission. Additionally, pre-clinical and clinical data have shown molnupiravir to be active against the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir was invented at Drug Innovations at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, a not-for-profit biotechnology company wholly owned by Emory University; Emory\/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Molnupiravir is being developed by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of molnupiravir have been provided by Merck and by Wayne and Wendy Holman of Ridgeback.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMolnupiravir is also being evaluated for post-exposure prophylaxis in MOVe-AHEAD, a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households.
