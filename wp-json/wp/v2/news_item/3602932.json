The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were nausea (63.2%), alopecia (60.2%), anemia (54.8%), neutropenia (46.9%), fatigue (42.1%), diarrhea (30.4%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (26.1%), vomiting (25.5%), asthenia (25.3%), rash (25.0%), constipation (24.0%), decreased neutrophil count (23.6%) and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (20.1%).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type of breast cancer, which has the highest risk of recurrence within the first five years after diagnosis and is associated with worse outcomes compared to other forms of breast cancer. While some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2, TNBC tests negative for all three. Triple-negative breast cancer is known to be prevalent in Japan, as approximately 15% of patients with breast cancer in Japan are diagnosed with TNBC. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in Japan, with more than 94,000 people diagnosed in 2020.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Approval in renal cell carcinoma<br \/>\n<br \/><\/b>The approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with RCC at increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-564 trial, in which KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 32% (HR=0.68 [95% CI, 0.53-0.87]; p=0.0010) compared to placebo.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-564, adverse reactions were observed in 386 patients (79.1%) out of the safety analysis set of 488 patients receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks or 400 mg every six weeks for up to 12 months. The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) were fatigue (20.3%), pruritus (18.6%), hypothyroidism (17.6%), diarrhea (15.8%), rash (15.0%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2%).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nRenal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCCs. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men than in women. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 25,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 8,000 deaths from the disease in 2020.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Approval in advanced cervical cancer<br \/>\n<br \/><\/b>The approval for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer with no prior chemotherapy who are not amenable to curative treatment is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-826 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 33% (HR=0.67 [95% CI, 0.54-0.84]; p=0.0003), and progression-free survival, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.53-0.79]; p&lt;0.0001), compared to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in these patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-826, adverse reactions were observed in 298 patients (97.1%) out of the safety analysis set of 307 patients (including 35\/35 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks in combination with investigator\u2019s choice of anti-cancer regimens.

All women are at risk for cervical cancer, and the disease is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 35 to 44. In Japan, it is estimated there were more than 12,700 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and nearly 4,200 deaths from the disease in 2020.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Expanded indication in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma<br \/>\n<br \/><\/b>The expanded indication for KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma after complete resection is based on results of the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-716 trial, in which KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment significantly prolonged recurrence-free survival, reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 35% (HR=0.65 [95% CI, 0.46-0.92]; p=0.00658) compared to placebo in these patients. With this expansion, Keytruda is now approved for the adjuvant treatment of resected stage IIB, IIC and stage III melanoma.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe Japanese package insert states that in KEYNOTE-716, adverse reactions were observed in 400 patients (82.8%) out of the safety analysis set of 483 patients (including 2\/2 Japanese patients) receiving KEYTRUDA at a dose of 200 mg every three weeks. The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) were pruritus (24.2%), fatigue (21.1%), diarrhea (18.6%), arthralgia (16.1%), rash (15.7%) and hypothyroidism (15.5%).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. In Japan, the rates of skin cancer have been rapidly increasing, and it is estimated there were more than 1,500 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and nearly 700 deaths from the disease in Japan in 2020.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <strong>About KEYTRUDA<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg<br \/>\n<br \/><\/strong>KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient&#8217;s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Selected KEYTRUDA<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.<br \/>\n<br \/><\/b><br \/>\n  <i>Melanoma<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nKEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <i>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nKEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) \u22651%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bwlistdisc\">\n<li>\nstage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or\n<\/li>\n<li>\nmetastatic.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\nKEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS \u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1\/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg\/kg\/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"bwuline\">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis<br \/>\n<br \/><\/span>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94\/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63\/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nPneumonitis occurred in 8% (31\/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"bwuline\">Immune-Mediated Colitis<br \/>\n<br \/><\/span>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection\/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48\/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33\/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"bwuline\">Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis<br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><br \/>\n  <i>KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19\/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13\/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <i>KEYTRUDA With Axitinib<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"bwuline\">Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies<br \/>\n<br \/><\/span><br \/>\n  <i>Adrenal Insufficiency<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22\/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17\/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <i>Hypophysitis<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17\/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16\/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <i>Thyroid Disorders<br \/>\n<br \/><\/i>KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1\/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1\/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  <b>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma<br \/>\n<br \/><\/b>In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.
